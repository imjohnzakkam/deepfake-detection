# What are Deepfakes?
A deepfake is content ( could be an image, video or even audio! ), generated by an artificial intelligence, that is authentic in the eyes of a human being. The word deepfake is a combination of the words “deep learning” and “fake,” and primarily relates to content generated by an artificial neural network, a branch of machine learning. The most common form of deepfakes involve the generation and manipulation of human imagery. [[1]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3425780)

Deepfakes are usually generated using some visual synthesis algorithms. For example, here is one sample which attempts to synthesize important features of humans like expressions, gaze, mouth, etc; along with some reenactment and replacement (also known as Face Swap) ![test](images/deepfake_synthesis.png)


# Datasets

Some of the state-of-the-art datasets which synthesize deepfakes very accurately are,
